# pmlt - python ml toolkit

This is a library for pedagogical purposes. Has my implementations of common ML algorithms from "scratch". 

Since "scratch" can mean a lot of things, here is a specific description for the code:

The numpy folder inside src will contain implementations using only numpy.

The pytorch folder inside src will contain pytorch implementations using pytorch functions.
